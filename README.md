# **Predictive Analysis for Manufacturing Operations**

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on building a predictive analytics solution for manufacturing operations to minimize downtime and enhance productivity. The system uses supervised machine learning models to predict machine downtime based on operational parameters. It provides RESTful API endpoints for data upload, model training, and prediction.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Upload Dataset**: Accepts a CSV dataset containing manufacturing operational data.
- **Train Model**: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree) to predict machine downtime.
- **Predict Outcome**: Provides predictions for machine downtime based on JSON input data.
- **RESTful API**: Easily integrates with manufacturing systems via accessible endpoints.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- **Testing Tools**: Postman or cURL
- **Documentation**: Markdown

## **API Endpoints**

### **1. Upload Dataset**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /upload`
- **Description**: Accepts a CSV file containing manufacturing data.
- **Request Body**: 
    ```json
    {
      "file": "manufacturing_data.csv"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Dataset uploaded successfully."
    }
    ```

### **2. Train Model**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /train`
- **Description**: Trains the machine learning model using the uploaded dataset.
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Model trained successfully.",
      "metrics": {
        "accuracy": 0.85,
        "f1_score": 0.88
      }
    }
    ```

### **3. Predict Downtime**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /predict`
- **Description**: Accepts input parameters and predicts machine downtime.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "Temperature": 85,
      "Run_Time": 120
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "Downtime": "Yes",
      "Confidence": 0.92
    }
    ```
